Description: 
        Falcontool is an attempt to provide tooling for quickly and easily starting a Falcon-based project.
         
        It is inspired by Django's `django-admin` and Flask's ` flask`.
        
        # Requirements
        The tool must do the following tasks:
        - Create a project repository given a `project_name`
        - Set up the basic project scaffolding, including:
          - Creating a skeleton `tox.ini` file
          - Creating a `tests` subdirectory
          - Creating a `src` subdirectory
          - Inside the `src` subdirectory, create:
            - An empty `api.py` file
          - Create a basic `requirements.txt` file in the root directory
          - Create an empty `README.md` file in the root directory
          - Create an empty `CODEOWNERS` file in the root directory
        - Allow for the creation of additional resources if specified by flags:
          - `--dockerfile` creates an empty `Dockerfile` in the root directory
          - `--modelsfile` creates an empty `models.py` in `src/api` directory
          - `--dbfile` creates an empty `db.py` in `src/api` directory
          - `--resourcesfile` creates an empty `resources.py` in `src/api` directory
          
        In addition to the above tasks, the tool should provide the following conveniences:
        - Provide a command to startup a Python console where a user can experiment with the project
        - Provide a command to run the projects test suite(s)
